# Use Cron with Python



### 1. Make sure your script works by running the following in this directory.

```bash
python write-file.py
```
You should see a new file called `write-file-output.txt` with something like:

```
2021-03-16 16:32:55
2021-03-16 16:32:57
2021-03-16 16:32:58
```
Note the `#!/usr/bin/python` line at the top of the .py file that makes it possible to run on the CLI. Next we'll tell cron to run this file automatically. But first, some setup:



### 2. Run this on the CLI to tell crontab to use nano editor (much easier!)

```bash
alias crontab='EDITOR=nano /usr/bin/crontab'
```


### 3. From this directory, type the following to see the full path to your directory. Copy it.

```bash
pwd
```

### 4. Now we'll tell cron to run this file every minute

```bash
crontab -e
```
and a new editor will open. Add the following, replacing the path with your own:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/this/directory/ && python ./write-file.py
```
It should look something like

```bash
* * * * * cd /Users/owenmundy/Documents/_code/dig333-raspberry-pi/time/cron-write-example/ && python ./write-file.py
```


### 5. Now open the `write-file-output.txt` file in Atom to see the new dates, once per minute:

```
2021-03-16 16:38:00
2021-03-16 16:39:00
2021-03-16 16:40:00
2021-03-16 16:41:00
```
